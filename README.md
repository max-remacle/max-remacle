I am Max and I am a Full Stack Software Developer looking for an organization where I can continue to grow in this fantastic industry.
I have a professional background in sales and data entry. I also have been a part if
the management team at Spark, where I learned administration
skills and motivational skills. I have a passion for creating
applications that can help people, whether this is through
solving challenges, improving efficiency or providing a positive
customer experience.

My workmates describe me as charismatic, genuine,
hardworking and helpful. I have been praised for the high
quality of work that I deliver and my willingness to help others.
I have developed a passion and strengths for most areas of
full stack development, from working with React and Redux to
designing and working with databases and servers.

I am a passionate and fast learner and I am always looking to
improve my knowledge and skills, therefore I am looking to
join an organization where I can continue to grow and develop.
Thus setting myself up for a successful career as a developer.

I am currenly working on a personal project that I have named Trifriend, which will allow my friends and I to be able to compare statistics from our favourite games in 
one easy and convienent place. This is a very much a passion project for me and I really enjoy working on it seeing it progress everyday.
